  GunstarHeroes, and SonicDrift2.
* Overall speed improvement, especially in the MSDOS port.
* Music is saved in the .SND format, player included.
* MSDOS port has got noise emulation, although not perfect one.

                            * INTRODUCTION *

  MasterGear is a portable emulator of two SEGA game consoles: the
MasterSystem (known as Mark3 in Japan) and the portable GameGear which is
basically an improved MasterSystem in a smaller package. The emulator is
written in C and therefore can be ported to any computer platform out
there, given that this platform can run 32-bit applications. You can
always get the latest MasterGear binaries and support files from

                 http://www.freeflight.com/fms/MG/

  At this moment, MG is able to run about 95% of the SMS/GG carts I have,
although the emulation is still far from perfection. With the help from
friends I hope to make it as close to original machines as possible. 

  If you have any information on the MasterSystem/GameGear, or the
ROM-images which can be used for testing, and are willing to help, feel
free to send mail to fms@freeflight.com. Any *intelligent* help is greatly
appreciated :).

  The following games have problems when running on MG:

  GP Rider             - The road sometimes gets distorted. Garbage when
                         selecting the motorcycle. Use -delay to fix it,
                         at least partially.
  XMen                 - Use -vperiod 7500.
  Altered Beast        - Restarts at the title. Use -vperiod 8500.
  Dynamite Headdy      - Screen sometimes blinks. Use -vperiod 10000. 
  Galaxy Force         - Some garbage at the top of a screen in the
                         Green World.
  Alex Kidd Lost Stars - Palette gets reset to zeroes.
  Surfing Ninjas       - Garbage at the title screens.
  Sonic Drift 2        - Screen sometimes blinks.
  Mickey Mouse GG      - Some problems after being killed in the
                         second level.
  Mahjong GG           - Distorted screen.
  Astro Warrior        - Remains of blown cannons are distorted.

  If you find a cause of any bugs mentioned above, or know of any other
game having problems, send me email. GP Rider, Astro Warrior and Mahjong 
bugs appear to be caused by a special handling of VRAM accesses when the 
second byte of VRAM address has two upper bits reset (normally, you need 
to set them to 01 for VRAM access). It is not clear how this works.



                             * BUTTONS *

  MasterGear is controlled by following buttons:

  [SPACE]    - FIRE-A button (also: [LALT],A,S,D,F,G,H,J,K,L)

  [ENTER]    - START button (only in GameGear mode)
  [TAB]      - RESET button (only in MasterSystem mode)
  [BACKSPC]  - PAUSE button (only in MasterSystem mode)
  [ESC]      - Quit emulation (also: [F12])
  [SHIFT] and [CAPSLOCK] switch between MasterSystem joypads

  [1]-[4]    - Turn sound channels on/off

                             * NOTES *

  The SMS/GG programming information will be available soon at
ftp.komkon.org. Both are nice little machines, logically structured and
much less weird than Nintendo hardware. The CPU used is Z80, the original
one, with no custom changes. Video controller seems to be based on a well
known TMS9918/9928 (MSX,Coleco,TI99/4), but has only one screenmode (as
far as I know), and is thoroughfully mutated in some other aspects. There 
is no BIOS ROM as in MSX or ColecoVision.

  MasterGear comes without any ROM images due to copyright reasons. 
Please, *do not* send me mail asking for ROM images: I can not give you
any, no matter how strongly you desire to get them. MasterGear works with
plain "raw" ROM images, and therefore the default file extension is .ROM. 
It may be a wise idea to use .SMS and .GG extensions to distinguish
between MasterSystem and GameGear ROMs though: the choice of extension is
not limited in any way.

  Some copiers add a 512-byte header to the ROM image files they create. 
If you see a ROM image whose size is a multiple of 16384 bytes + 512,
simply cut off the first 512 bytes to et the raw image. Unix users can do 
it in a following way:

            dd if=<input-file> of=<output-file> skip=1 bs=512

  If you want to get a bigger window in MasterGear-Unix/X, or your Xserver
is 16/24bit (the generic version of MasterGear only supports 256-color
Xservers), check out the improved Unix/X drivers by Ian Spielman,
available at

                  http://hepserver.nhn.uoknor.edu/

  When compiled with ZLIB option, MasterGear will be able to transparently
handle files packed with GZIP and ZIP, which helps to save the disk space.
You will need the ZLib library by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler though.
Its source is available at

                    http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/

  The MSDOS version can be compiled with GIFLIB option. Then, it will
allow you to load backdrop pictures from the .GIF files, and save screen
snapshots into .GIF files by pressing [F4]. You will need the GIFLib
library by Gershon Elber, available from SimTel and other archives. 

  Since version 0.6, MasterGear checks the file extension and forces
emulation into MasterSystem or GameGear mode if extension is .SMS or .GG. 
In the GameGear mode, the country code is also checked. If the cartridge
is either for Japan or for US/Europe only, and there was no
nationalization option given, the nationalization switch is forced into an
appropriate state. 

That's it. Have fun!
